## Theoretical part SELF-TEST

1.	Please formulate a hypothesis on how cultural modernisation (e.g. more equal gender norms) may have affected assortative mating. Please focus on the impact of cultural modernisation on ‘preferences’. Please motivate your answer.  
2.	Please formulate a hypothesis on how continuing educational expansion (which has been more pronounced for women than for men) may have affected patterns of homogamy.  Please focus on the impact of educational expansion on ‘the structure of search’. Please motivate your answer.   
3. This question is about intermarriage.  
  (A) Why would people prefer to marry someone who is similar?  
  (B) Why would people prefer to marry someone who is dissimilar?  
  (C) To what extent do you expect these reasons – mentioned in 3A and 3B to hold with respect to online relations (e.g. ‘friend’ relations on Facebook or ‘follower’ relations on Twitter)? Thus, with online relations I do not mean ‘romantic’ relations but simply forming a tie (e.g. befriending someone on Facebook; ad-mention someone on twitter; etc.). Please motivate your answer.   
4.	What does Kalmijn (1998) mean with the by-product hypothesis?    
5.	What does Schwartz (2013) mean with the economic inequality hypothesis and what role do returns to schooling play in this idea/hypothesis?   
6.	Please give at least two reasons why increased assortative mating could increase economic inequality.  
7.	Pop et al. (2008) describe their peer nomination instruments. How do you think results will depend on whether or not reciprocated or non-reciprocated friendships would have been used to identify the dyads. Please motivate your answer.  
8.	To explain social-phenomena we generally follow Coleman’s boat. Please come up with your own example in which you explain the relationship between two macro-level phenomena by going from the macro to the micro-level, from the micro-level to the micro-level, from the micro-level to the macro-level again.
