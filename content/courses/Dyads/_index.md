# ## Flexibility

# This feature can be used for publishing content such as:
# 
# * **Online courses**
# * **Project or software documentation**
# * **Tutorials**
# 
# The `courses` folder may be renamed. For example, we can rename it to `docs` for software/project documentation or `tutorials` for creating an online course.
# 
# ## Delete tutorials
# 
# **To remove these pages, delete the `courses` folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.**
# 
# ## Update site menu
# 
# After renaming or deleting the `courses` folder, you may wish to update any `[[main]]` menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at `config/_default/menus.toml`.
# 
# For example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:
# 
# ```toml
# [[main]]
#   name = "Courses"
#   url = "courses/"
#   weight = 50
# ```
# 
# Or, if you are creating a software documentation site, you can rename the `courses` folder to `docs` and update the associated *Courses* menu configuration to:
# 
# ```toml
# [[main]]
#   name = "Docs"
#   url = "docs/"
#   weight = 50
# ```
# 
# ## Update the docs menu
# 
# If you use the *docs* layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form `[menu.X]` where `X` is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the `courses/example/` folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within `courses/example/` from `[menu.example]` to `[menu.<NewFolderName>]`.
