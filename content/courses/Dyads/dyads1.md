## General Theoretical Framework

In this section, I would like to introduce a General Theoretical Framework which can be used to explain more or less any social phenomena you are interested in. The GTF can thus also be used to explain the emergence of social networks, and thus also to explain the emergence of dyads, and thus also to explain intermarriage.  
This GTF, however, does not provide us immediately with testable hypothesis. We need to fill in the blanks, we need to make the abstract concepts in the GTF concrete. And that is exactly what we will do in the next sections.

After having watched the video and after heaving read the further clarifications, you should be able to:  
- Understand and summarize the building blocks of the multi-level framework which can be used to explain the emergence of social networks.  
  - macro-level (independent) variable(s)  
    - social conditions  
    - restrictions  
  - bridge assumptions (also called social context effects)  
  - Theory of Action  
    - preferences
    - resources
    - choice-set
    - choice-input
    - choice-output
  - Transformation rules (also called aggregation mechanism)
    - social interdependencies
    - unintended/unforeseen consequences of micro-level behavior
  - macro-level (dependent) variable
- Provide examples of all building blocks in the context of explaining the emergence of dyads
