## Overview  

Sociologists study how societies and communities in which people are connected – **social networks** – influence our attitudes and behaviors. These attitudes and behaviors of individuals (*individual-level*) give rise to social phenomena (*macro-level*) such as *inequality*, *segregation*, *polarization* and *cohesion*. It is however not straightforward to explain or understand these social phenomena from the attitudes and behaviors of individuals alone. This is because individuals are connected to each other and to institutions like families and schools. That is, individuals are embedded in many different social networks. Within social networks we both intentionally and unintentionally influence each others attitudes and behaviors (via complex dynamic processes). Moreover, our attitudes and behaviors will set *normative and structural constraints* for the attitudes and behaviors of others with whom we are connected. During the course you will come across many examples of these so-called *interdependencies*. 

It is crucial to take into account the *interconnectedness* of individuals and thus the role of social networks if wish to explain and solve social problems. It can thus be no surprise that the study of the causes and consequences of social networks, therefore, lies at the core of sociology.   

## Aim 

The intended learning outcomes of the course are:
1. Theoretical knowledge and insight: you will be able to define core concepts related to a social network perspective and are able to summarize what a social network perspective in social science research entails.  
2. Academic attitude: you develop a positive attitude towards applying a social network perspective in social science research.   
3. Research skills: you will be able to apply a social network perspective in social science research. This encompasses being able to deduce relevant and new social network hypotheses from existing theories and being able to test these hypotheses with different social network analysis techniques. 

## Structure
This course is structured along three different dimensions: (1) the type of Social Network; (2) whether we will discuss how these networks arise, the causes of these social networks, or on what the consequences of these networks are; (3) whether we will discuss the theoretical or methodological implications of applying a social network perspective.

## Definitions  

Social Networks
:  definition of social networks

> *Social Networks*: 

> *individual-level*:  

> *macro-level*:  

> *inequality*:   

> *segregation*: 

> *polarization*:  

> *cohesion*:  

> *normative and structural constraints*:  

> *interdependencies / interconnectedness*: 


> *A Social Network Perspective*: A social network perspective is no theory and no method. It is simply the acknowledgment that (1) individuals are embedded within social networks - no man is an island -  and that this has consequences for our theories; (2) that observations of individuals are not independent and that this has consequences for many of our traditonal research methods which assume indepence of observations.
