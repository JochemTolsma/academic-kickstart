## Overview  

Sociologists study how societies (or groups and communities) (*macro-level*) affect the lives of their members (*individual-level*) and, vice versa, how individuals shape the societies in which they live. Within societies people form relations with specific others and thereby form **social networks**.  
Individuals are embedded in many different social networks (e.g. based on friendships, bullying, family relations). Within these social networks individuals both intentionally and unintentionally influence each others' *attitudes*, *behaviors* and *relations* via complex dynamic processes. 
The attitudes, behaviors and relations of individuals shape, in turn, the societies they live in. They give rise to social phenomena such as *inequality*, *segregation*, *polarization* and *cohesion*. It is however not possible to explain these macro-level social phenomena, let alone to solve social problems, without taking into account that individuals are connected to each other in social networks. For example, you may have a good idea about where my personal political attitudes come from but this does not explain political polarization, why specific groups in society hold ever more opposing, extreme political attitudes.  
It is crucial to take into account the *interconnectedness* of individuals and thus the role of social networks if we wish to explain and solve social problems. It can thus be no surprise that the study of the causes and consequences of social networks lies at the core of sociology.   

## Aim 

The intended learning outcomes of the course are:
1. Theoretical knowledge and insight: you will be able to define core concepts related to a social network perspective and are able to summarize what a social network perspective in social science research entails.  
2. Academic attitude: you develop a positive attitude towards applying a social network perspective in social science research.   
3. Research skills: you will be able to apply a social network perspective in social science research. This encompasses being able to deduce relevant and new social network hypotheses from existing theories and being able to test these hypotheses with different social network analysis techniques. 

## Structure
This course is structured along three different dimensions: (1) the type of Social Network; (2) causes versus consequences of social networks; (3) theoretical versus methodological implications of a social network perspective.

## Causes and Consequences
**...or Selection and Influence**  
Social networks consist of social relations between people. For example friendship, bullying relations or working-together-during-the-course-social-networks relations.  
The continuous process of making and braking social relations is also called *selection*. And the reasons why we make and brake relations with specific persons are important *causes* for the structures of the social networks we observe. Thus the causes of social networks are strongly related to selection processes.  
The people with whom we form social relations also *influence* our attitudes, behaviors and future relations. How we think, behave and with whom we make, brake or maintain social relations is for an important part the *consequence* of the social networks in which we are embedded. Thus the consequences of social networks are strongly related to influence processes (but also to selection processes).  
Selection and influence processes are firmly entangled. See below for an example. We could call the selection process 'Opposite Attracts' and we could call the influence process 'circle beats square'.[^1] 

[^1]: The shapes represent social agents (e.g. individuals).  
  The shape (circle or square) of the social agent is a time-stable characteristic (e.g. sex).  
  The fill of the shape (no fill, pattern fill, solid fill) is a time-varying characteristic (e.g. music taste).  
  The line between the shapes (no line, dashed, solid) signifies the strength of the relationship (e.g. romantic relationship)

## What makes this course stand out? 
This course is not an introduction to Social Networks or Social Network Analysis. It is also not a course in R. I assume you have some intuitive understanding of what social networks are and have opened R or RStudio at one point in your life but both are not necessary prerequisites to follow this course. There are very good introductions to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html) and the study of Social Networks.[^2]  
This course is tailored for research master and PhD students. I will assume that you are interested in and have studied social problems in your academic career and that your research interests fits one of the following broad themes: **inequality**, **cohesion** and **diversity**. However, up to this point, when you deduced hypotheses from existing theories you did not explicitly acknowledge that individuals are interconnected in social networks. You was neither aware that this may have theoretical consequences for existing hypotheses nor that this gives rise to new research questions. Up to this point, when you tested your hypotheses you assumed that your observations were independent (e.g. OLS) or, at most, that the interdependencies were relatively easily to take into account (e.g. multi-level analysis).[^3]  
In this course you will learn to apply a social network perspective in the study of inequality, cohesion and diversity. You will become able to deduce more precise and new hypotheses. You will become able to test these hypotheses with social network techniques that take into account and explain complex interdependencies.

[^3]: That individuals are interconnected and hence that observations are not independent can be seen as a **nuisance**. That our observations are not independent violates many assumptions of analysis techniques that social scientists commonly apply (e.g. OLS). In order to correctly estimate the effects of interest we need to take these interdependencies into account with social network analysis techniques.  
  However, that individuals are interconnected and hence that observations are correlated or co-vary also is **theoretically interesting**. It gives rise to a complete new type of research questions. Where normally our research questions refer to describing or explaining the variance between individuals (e.g. why individuals differ) the new set of research questions refer to describing and explaining the covariance between individuals (why some people are more (dis)similar to one another than others.)

## Definitions

Social Network Perspective
: It is the acknowledgment that:  
1. Individuals are embedded within social networks - no man is an island -  and that this has consequences for our theories.  
2. Empiracal bservations of individuals are not always independent and that the (complex) interdependencies between observations have  consequences for many of our traditional research methods which assume independence of observations. 
  
Applying a social network perspective leads to theoretical and methodological advancements. A social network perspective is no theory and no method.
