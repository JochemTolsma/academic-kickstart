## Theoretical part SELF-TEST


1.	**Egocentric networks: Consequences-Period Trends**  
**A.**	What is meant by raw homophily rates, structural/baseline homophily and taste/inbreeding homophily?  
**B.**  What is mean by network size, network composition, network structure, network stability?   
**C.**	Please formulate a hypothesis with respect to period trends in the size of core discussion networks. Motivate your answer by explaining how you applied the GTF.  
**D.**	Please formulate a hypothesis with respect to period trends in the homophily rates within friendship networks. Motivate your answer by explaining how you applied the GTF.     
**E.**	Please formulate a hypothesis with respect to period trends in the stability of acquaintance networks. Motivate your answer by explaining how you applied the GTF.  
**F.**	Do a ‘quick’ literature search and see if there is already empirical evidence for C, D and E. Please cite the literature used. Motivate your answer.   

2.	**Egocentric networks: Consequences-Lifecourse trends**  
**A.**	Please consider the standard measurement instrument for the CDN. Are, according to you, the mentioned ‘confidants’ strong ties? Motivate your answer.   
**B.**	In Small et al. (2015), the authors made a typology of the possible dynamics in a CDN. Do these reflect all possibilities?   
**C.**	Could you give an example of an online egocentric network? Please define the alter, ego and type of tie.   
**D.**	Would you expect different dynamics – i.e. lifecourse trends – in your online egocentric network of 2C as compared to the CDN that Small et al. (2015) studied? Motivate your answer.  
  
3.	**Egocentric networks: Consequences**  
**A.**	Briefly summarize the theories (or mechanisms) mentioned in Brechwald et al. (2011) explaining peer influence.   
**B.**	Which mechanisms of A are tested in Rokven et al. (2017)?   
**C.**	According to Brechwald et al. (2011: 168) it is important to ‘understanding peer influence in a clique context – and when possible, attempting to compare effects of groups and dyads’. Do you think Rokven et al. (2017) followed up on this advice? Please motivate your answer.   
**D.**	Rokven et al. (2017) pay considerable attention to what Brechwald et al. (2011) calls ‘peer influence moderators’. At which ‘level’ (see Brechwald) do Rokven’s moderators belong? Please motivate your answer.   
**E.**	I think that Brechwald missed some moderator-levels. Most importantly I think a fifth level should have been moderators at the network-level. Thus characteristics of the network that may moderate peer influence. Please formulate a research question (not a hypothesis) on how network-characteristics moderate the influence of friends’ involvement in crime on the risk of offending and victimization. Please motivate your answer why this would be an interesting research question.
