<p>Although I just <strong>love</strong> my work, I do have one somewhat time-consuming hobby: Triathlon!</p>
<p>Because of the Covid Pandemic all official events have been cancelled. This led Peter-Jan Mol, my friend and club mate, at <a href="www.tvcerberus.nl">Cerberus</a> to organize his own full triathlon in the beautiful surroundings of Molenhoek, the MolMan.</p>
<p>For me a full triathlon is 1.9km swimming, 90km biking and a half marathon too far. I thus joined the side event, the 70.3 MolMan.</p>
<p>The swimstart was at the Mookerplas. Completed deserted this early in the morning (8:00).</p>

<p>After that on to the bike. Unfortunately, I parked my bike in Transition zone 1 in some glass and thus had to change my inner tube within the first km. Luckily, I had all equipment with me, something I usually donâ€™t do in a real event. Have a look at my fancy speedsuit of my bike club <a href="https://www.rtcgroenewoud.nl/home">R&amp;TC Groenewoud</a>.</p>

<p>90Km later and after a somewhat slow transition (I changed into running gear) I headed out for a 21km trail run in the surroundings of the Mookerhei. Temperatures were brutal reaching 30 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Five hours and eleven minutes later I finished!</p>
