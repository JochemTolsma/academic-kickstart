## The Conceptual Model  

### Version 1 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM2.PNG")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Moderation", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM6a.PNG")
```

The moderator **Mo** moderates the strength of the impact of **X** on **Y** (i.e. path **a**).  


---  


### Version 2

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM2.PNG")
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Moderation (including direct effect of moderator)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM6b.PNG")
```

In Version 2, the direct effect of the Moderator **Mo** on **Y** is also drawn. You may not have theorized an effect of **Mo** on **Y** and it thus not always necessary to draw this relationship but it is a good idea to consider whether this relationship may exist. When testing for the moderation effect **b** it is good practice for the direct of of the Moderator (path **d**) as it will facilitate the interpretation of the moderation effect.  

---  


### Version 3

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM2.PNG")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Moderation (equivalent to version 2)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM6c.PNG")
```

Version 2 and Version 3 are (mathematically) equivalent (structural) models. They will lead to exactly the same model fit. However, from a theoretical viewpoint they are different. (see also examples below).  
  

---  



### Version 4

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM2.PNG")
```

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Moderation (categorical Moderator)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM6d.PNG")
```
If your Moderator is a nominal variable (e.g. gender) it may be more informative for a reader to graphically summarize the model for each category (e.g. men, women, other) separately. This may be especially useful if your model is more complex and includes more independent variables and or mediation variables and you expect more than one relationship to differ depending on gender.[^3] 

[^3]: You may also want to estimate the model separately for subgroups because you expect different (error)variances in your dependent variable across subgroups. 

---  


## Explanation  

In a conceptual model, the concepts are normally placed in a rectangular. We have three concepts, **X**, **Mo** and **Y**.  
We assume an association between X and Y. 
The strength of this relation may depend on **Mo**, the strength of this relation is conditional on the value of **Mo**.  We also call this an interaction effect. 
If you want to graphically depict a moderation, it may be useful to show the model without the moderator as well but this is a bit a matter of taste. I have noticed that journal article reviewers and committees that evaluate grant proposals are not always familiar with a graphical depiction of an interaction effect. I have received (more than once!) the comment that my figure was presumably wrong because an arrow was pointing at a different arrow. I therefore now add a very small bullit on the arrow which, I hope, makes clear that it is by design that I point one arrow to another arrow.    
It is not always necessary to label the paths but for this tutorial it will turn out to be handy. Normally, when there is no sign (or label) it is assumed that the path has a positive valence. It is, however, good practice to include the valence of the paths in your conceptual models.  


{{% alert warning %}}
If the relationship between **X** and **Y** is assumed to be non-linear, for example when the dependent variable is binary and you are planning to estimate logistic regression models, the interpretation of moderation/interaction effects is a lot more complicated. **SEE STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS BELOW**.

## Abstract hypotheses  

See Version 1/2 above. 

### positive main effect, positive interaction  

- Hypo1: more X leads to more Y ($a>0$).  
- Hypo2: The relationship between X and Y becomes stronger when Mo increases ($b>0$).  

### positive main effect, negative interaction  

- Hypo1: more X leads to more Y ($a>0$).  
- Hypo2: The relationship between X and Y becomes weaker when Mo increases ($b<0$).  

### negative main effect, positive interaction  

- Hypo1: more X leads to less Y ($a<0$).  
- Hypo2: The negative relationship between X and Y becomes weaker when Mo increases ($b>0$).  

### negative main effect, negative interaction  

- Hypo1: more X leads to less Y ($a<0$).  
- Hypo2: The negative relationship between X and Y becomes stronger when Mo increases ($b<0$).

## Real life example  

X is educational success
Mo is age.  
Y is health 

- Hypo1: Educational success is (positively) related to a better health. 
- Hypo2: The positive relationship between educational success and a better health is stronger for older persons.  

Alternatively, one could also formulate just the interaction effect:   

- Hypo3: The relationship between educational success and a better health is stronger for older persons.  

For hypothesis 3 it is not necessary that there is also a main effect of education on health. Also, the direction of the interaction effect is left a bit implicit (presumably positive). But cannot be falsified when:  

- there is no main effect and we observe an interaction effect (regardless of sign)  
- there is a positive main effect and a positive interaction effect.  
- there is a negative main effect and a negative interaction effect.   


For this reason, I would prefer hypotheses 1 and 2 above the single hypothesis 3.  

Please compare the following set of hypotheses: 

- Hypo1: Educational success is (positively) related to a better health. 
- Hypo2: Age is (negatively) related to a better health. 
- Hypo3a: The positive relationship between educational success and a better health is stronger for older persons.   

and: 

- Hypo1: Educational success is (positively) related to a better health. 
- Hypo2: Age is (negatively) related to a better health. 
- Hypo3b: The negative relationship between age and a better health is weaker for higher educated persons.  

Both sets will lead to the same structural equations. But do you think that for older persons education based inequality in health will be more pronounced or that for higher educated age based inequality in health will be less pronounced?

## Structural equations   

- $ Y= b_0 + b_1X + b_2Mo + b_3XMo \equiv Y= b_0 + (b_1 + b_3Mo)X + b_2Mo $

### Interpretation (linear model)

The interaction effect is the cross-partial derivative of Y with respect to X and M0:[^1]

[^1]: Assuming continuous variables X and Mo.

$$ \frac{\partial ^2(Y|X,Mo)}{\partial X \partial Mo} = \frac{\partial(b_1 + b_3Mo)}{ \partial Mo} = b_3 $$

Thus the interaction effect is $b_3$. 

### Interpretation (non-linear (logit) model)

However, if we have a binary outcome variable our hypotheses are about the probability that Y is 1 ($P(Y=1)$). If we estimate the model with a logit function, this is:[^2]

[^2]: The same logic applies to other nonlinear models of course. 

$P(Y=1|X,Mo)= \frac{e^{(b_0 + b_1X + b_2Mo + b_3XMo)}} {1 + e^{(b_0 + b_1X + b_2Mo + b_3XMo)}} =  \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1X + b_2Mo + b_3XMo)}}$


let us define $P(Y=1|X,Mo)$ as $F(Y)$ (i.e. the logistic distribution function). 

The interaction effect then becomes: 

$$ \frac{\partial ^2 F(Y)}{\partial X \partial Mo} = \frac{\partial(f(Y)(b_1 + b_3Mo))}{ \partial Mo} = f(Y)b_3 + f'(Y)(b_1 + b_3Mo)(b_2 + b_3X), $$
where $f(Y)$ is the derivative of the logistic distribution function (i.e. the logistic density function) and $f'(Y)$ the derivative of the density function with respect to Y. 

For more background reading see @norton2004computing.

For now we have three take home messages!:  

- even if $b_3$ is non significant you may have a significant interaction effect (namely: $f'(Y)b_1b_2$ 
- the strength, valence (and significance) of the interaction effect depends on the value of $Y$ (i.e. the covariates), $b_1$, $b_2$ and $b_3$.  
- **To make sense of interaction effects in nonlinear models, use (3D) plots of predicted values against values of X and Mo!**

### Lavaan syntax  

Following the syntax of the R package **Lavaan**

- Y~1   
- Y~a*X  
- Y~d*Mo  
- Y~b*X:Mo

## Formal test of hypotheses  {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Load the NELLS data.  

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) #empty environment
require(haven)
nells <- read_dta("../static/NELLS panel nl v1_2.dta") #change directory name to your working directory
```

Operationalize concepts. Please note that I mean center the covariates for ease of interpretation!

```{r}
# We will use the data of wave 2.

# As an indicator of occupational success we will use income in wave 2.
table(nellsw2$w2fa61, useNA="always")
attributes(nellsw2$w2fa61)
#recode (I will start newly created variables with cm from conceptual models)

#as an indicator of educational success we will use highest completed level of education in years.
#the rationale behind this coding this I will take the maximum for university as 16.5 (taking into account that some masters are 2 years and some 1 year) and subsequently subtract the years needed to obtain a university degree given the degree under consideration. 

attributes(nellsw2$w2fa102)
table(nellsw2$w2fa102, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_education <- nellsw2$w2fa102
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==1] <- 6
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==2] <- 9
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==3] <- 10

nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==15] <- 4



#mean centering
nellsw2$cm_education_c <- nellsw2$cm_education - mean(nellsw2$cm_education, na.rm = T)
nellsw2$cm_age_c <- nellsw2$w1cage - mean(nellsw2$w1cage, na.rm = T)

#define a dichotemous moderator based on age. 
nellsw2$cm_old_d <- ifelse(nellsw2$cm_age_c>=0, 1, 0)


#as an indicator of health we will use subjective well being from 5 (excellent) to 1 (bad) thus we have to reverse code original variable
attributes(nellsw2$w2scf1)
table(nellsw2$w2scf1, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_health <- 6 - nellsw2$w2scf1

```

And test the model with **Lavaan**.

### Interaction variable approach

```{r}
require(lavaan)

model <- '
  #structural model 
  cm_health~ a*cm_education_c + d*cm_age_c + b*cm_education_c:cm_age_c
  #intercepts
  cm_health~1
  cm_education_c ~1
  cm_age_c~1
  
  #residual variance
  cm_health ~~ cm_health
  
  #variances
  cm_education_c ~~ cm_age_c
'



fit <- lavaan(model, data = nellsw2, auto.var=T, meanstructure=T) 
summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)

```


We observe that higher educated persons report higher SWB.  
We observe that older persons report lower SWB.  
We observe that the relationship between education and SWB is higher for older persons. 

### multigroup approach

```{r}
require(lavaan)
#no equality constraints across groups whatsoever. 
model <- '
  #structural model 
  cm_health~ c(a1,a0)*cm_education_c #I am giving the education effects specific names for each group
  #intercepts
  cm_health~1
  
  #residual variance
  cm_health ~~ cm_health
  
  #test for difference
  a1a0:=a1-a0
'



fit <- lavaan(model, data = nellsw2, auto.var=T, meanstructure=T, group="cm_old_d") 
summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)

```

We observe that the relationship between education and SWB is significantly higher for older persons.
