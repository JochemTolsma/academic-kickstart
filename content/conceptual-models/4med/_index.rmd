## The Conceptual Model  

```{r correlation, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Direct effect", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM2.PNG")
```

```{r mediation, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mediation", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM4.PNG")
```

## Explanation  

In a conceptual model, the concepts are normally placed in a rectangular. We have three concepts, **X**, **Me** and **Y**.  
We assume a causal relationship running from X to Y (See Figure 1 \ref{correlation}). 
We assume that in part this relationship can be explained by a Mediator, Me (see Figure 2 \ref{mediation}). If you want to graphically depict a mediation mechanism, it may be useful to show the model without the mediator as well but this is a bit a matter of taste.  
It is not always necessary to label the paths but for this tutorial it will turn out to be handy. Normally, when there is no sign (or label) it is assumed that the path has a positive valence. It is, however, good practice to include the valence of the paths in your conceptual models.

## Abstract hypothesis/hypotheses  

### Mediation  

- Hypo1: X leads to Y ($a>0$).  
- Hypo2: X leads to Me ($b>0$).  
- Hypo3: Me leads to Y ($c>0$).  
- Hypo4: Me mediates the relationship of X to Y ($a' < a \equiv b*c>0$)

{{% alert note %}}
Please note, that:  
- hypothesis 4 may hold even if hypothesis 2 and 3 are false. 
- hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 may be true but that hypothesis 1 is false.  

It is thus good practice to accept your mediation mechanism only if all four hypotheses hold true. Or more precisely, if you cannot refute any of the four hypotheses.

### Suppression 

Supression is closely related to mediation. It means that after taking into account Me the initial relations between X and Y becomes stronger. 

This may occur when:  

- $a>0$ and ($a' > a \equiv b*c<0$)

or:  

- $a<0$ and ($a' < a \equiv b*c>0$)

## Real life example  

X is educational success
Me is occupational success.  
Y is health 

- Hypo1: Educational success leads to a better health. 
- Hypo2: Educational success leads to occupational success.  
- Hypo3: Occupational success leads to a better health.  
- Hypo4: The relationship between educational success and health becomes weaker once we take into account that educational success causes occupational success and occupational success leads to a better health. 

You will often encounter Hypo4s formulated as: The causal relation between educational success and health is (in part) explained by occupational success. 


{{% alert warning %}}
I hope you notice that a mediation model is very similar to the model with two direct effects. The only difference is that we now assume a causal path between X and Me and not a correlation between $ X_1 $ and $ X_2 $.

## Structural equations   

- Y=X  
- Y=Me 
- Me=X

or, following the syntax of the R package **Lavaan**

- Y~X + Me  
- Me~X

## Formal test of hypotheses  

Load the NELLS data.  

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) #empty environment
require(haven)
nells <- read_dta("../static/NELLS panel nl v1_2.dta") #change directory name to your working directory
```

Operationalize concepts.

```{r}
# We will use the data of wave 2.
nellsw2<- nells[nells$w2cpanel==1,]

# As an indicator of occupational success we will use income in wave 2.
table(nellsw2$w2fa61, useNA="always")
attributes(nellsw2$w2fa61)
#recode (I will start newly created variables with cm from conceptual models)
nellsw2$cm_income <- nellsw2$w2fa61
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==1] <- 100
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==2] <- 225
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==3] <- 400
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==4] <- 750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==5] <- 1250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==6] <- 1750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==7] <- 2250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==8] <- 2750

nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==13] <- 5250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==14] <- 5750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==15] <- 6500
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==16] <- 7500
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==17] <- NA
# let us scale the variable a bit and translate into income per 1000euro
nellsw2$cm_income <- nellsw2$cm_income/1000

#from household income to personal income
attributes(nellsw2$w2fa62)
table(nellsw2$w2fa62, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_income_per <- nellsw2$w2fa62
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==1] <- 0
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==2] <- 10
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==3] <- 20
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==4] <- 30
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==5] <- 40
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==6] <- 50
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==7] <- 60
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==8] <- 70
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==9] <- 80
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==10] <- 90
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==11] <- 100
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==12] <- NA

nellsw2$cm_income_ind <- nellsw2$cm_income * nellsw2$cm_income_per/100

#as an indicator of educational success we will use highest completed level of education in years.
#the rationale behind this coding this I will take the maximum for university as 16.5 (taking into account that some masters are 2 years and some 1 year) and subsequently subtract the years needed to obtain a university degree given the degree under consideration. 

attributes(nellsw2$w2fa102)
table(nellsw2$w2fa102, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==1] <- 6
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==2] <- 9
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==3] <- 10
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==4] <- 11
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==5] <- 12
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==6] <- 10
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==7] <- 11
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==8] <- 14
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==9] <- 15
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==10] <- 16.5
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==11] <- 16.5
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==12] <- 7
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==13] <- 11
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==14] <- 14.5
nellsw2$cm_education[nellsw2$w2fa102==15] <- 4


#as an indicator of health we will use subjective well being from 5 (excellent) to 1 (bad) thus we have to reverse code original variable
attributes(nellsw2$w2scf1)
table(nellsw2$w2scf1, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_health <- 6 - nellsw2$w2scf1

```

And test the model with **Lavaan**.

```{r}
require(lavaan)
var(nellsw2$cm_income_ind, na.rm=TRUE)

model <- '
  # direct effect
  cm_health ~ a*cm_education  
  # mediator 
  cm_income_ind ~ b*cm_education
  cm_health ~ c*cm_income_ind 
  # indirect effect 
  bc := b*c  
  # total effect  
  total := a + (b*c)
'

fit <- sem(model, data = nellsw2) 
summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)
inspect(fit,'r2') #to obtain r-squared
```

We need to refute our mediation mechanism. Do you see why?  
Well, because income is not related to SWB, at least not when we take into account educational success. Our *c-path* is not significant.
Thus, the reason why we observed a positive relation between income and SWB previously was because of **omitted variable bias**.
