## The Conceptual Model  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="two direct effects", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM3a.PNG")
```


---  

## Explanation  

In a conceptual model, the concepts are normally placed in a rectangular. We have three concepts, ** $ X_1 $ **,  ** $ X_2 $ ** and **Y**.  
The single headed arrow indicates that you assume causal (linear) relations from ** $ X_1 $ ** and  ** $ X_2 $ ** (on the left) to **Y** on the right. Thus: if $ X_1 $ or $ X_2 $ increases, Y will increase as a result as well.
In this example we have to direct effects. The implicit assumption of a conceptual model is that (both) concepts have an additive effect. Naturally, there would in principle be nothing wrong with a multiplicative effect/model.     
It is not always necessary to label the paths but for this tutorial it will turn out to be handy. Normally, when there is no sign (or label) it is assumed that the path has a positive valence. It is, however, good practice to include the valence of the paths in your conceptual models, i.e. replace *a* with *+* or *-*.  


{{% alert note %}}
Please note, I use the label *concept* and not *variable*. A *variable* is something that is part of your dataset, measured by, for example, a survey item. A concept is a theoretical construct, and the concept as intended may have relations - according to your theory - with other concepts. This concept is measured by one or more variables, the 'concept as measured'.  
It is generally a good idea to use concepts that are (very) close to your actual measurements. Thus, although you may use the concept *social cohesion* in your conceptual model, this concept is overly broad and there is a fierce debate on how it should be defined. If you have measured social cohesion with for example a single item on generalized trust ("Generally speaking would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?") why not use the concept generalized trust in your conceptual model?

## Abstract hypothesis/hypotheses  

Hypo1: $ X_1 $ leads to Y.  
Hypo2: $ X_2 $ leads to Y.

Normally we do not have an hypothesis on the association between $ X_1 $ and $ X_2 $. If we do, we could summarize our ideas with the following conceptual model: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="two direct effects and association", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/CM3b.PNG")
```
Hypo3: $ X_1 $ and $ X_2 $ are positively associated. 

---  

## Real life example  

$ X_1 $ is occupational success.  
$ X_2 $ is being in a relationship (YES/NO)
Y is health 

Hypo1: Occupational success will lead to better health. (Money makes happy.)
Hypo2: Being in a relationship will lead to better health. (Love makes happy.)


---  

## Structural equations   

- $ Y = X_1 $  
- $ Y = X_2 $  
- $ X_1 = X_2 $  

or, following the syntax of the R package **Lavaan**

- Y~$X_1$   
- Y~$X_2$
- $X_1$~~$X_2$

The single `~` indicates a direct effect (regression path). 
The double `~~` indicates a (partial), (error)variance.

## Formal test of hypotheses  

Load the NELLS data.  

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) #empty environment
require(haven)
nells <- read_dta("../static/NELLS panel nl v1_2.dta") #change directory name to your working directory
```

Operationalize concepts.

```{r}
# We will use the data of wave 2.
nellsw2<- nells[nells$w2cpanel==1,]

# As an indicator of occupational success we will use income in wave 2.
table(nellsw2$w2fa61, useNA="always")
attributes(nellsw2$w2fa61)
#recode (I will start newly created variables with cm from conceptual models)
nellsw2$cm_income <- nellsw2$w2fa61
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==1] <- 100
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==2] <- 225
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==3] <- 400
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==4] <- 750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==5] <- 1250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==6] <- 1750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==7] <- 2250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==8] <- 2750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==9] <- 3250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==10] <- 3750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==11] <- 4250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==12] <- 4750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==13] <- 5250
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==14] <- 5750
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==15] <- 6500
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==16] <- 7500
nellsw2$cm_income[nellsw2$cm_income==17] <- NA
# let us scale the variable a bit and translate into income per 1000euro
nellsw2$cm_income <- nellsw2$cm_income/1000

#from household income to personal income
attributes(nellsw2$w2fa62)
table(nellsw2$w2fa62, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_income_per <- nellsw2$w2fa62
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==1] <- 0
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==2] <- 10
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==3] <- 20
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==4] <- 30
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==5] <- 40
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==6] <- 50
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==7] <- 60
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==8] <- 70
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==9] <- 80
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==10] <- 90
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==11] <- 100
nellsw2$cm_income_per[nellsw2$cm_income_per==12] <- NA

nellsw2$cm_income_ind <- nellsw2$cm_income * nellsw2$cm_income_per/100

#habing a partner
attributes(nellsw2$w2fb1)
table(nellsw2$w2fb1, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_partner <- as.factor(ifelse(nellsw2$w2fb1==1,0,1))

#as an indicator of health we will use subjective well being from 5 (excellent) to 1 (bad) thus we have to reverse code original variable

attributes(nellsw2$w2scf1)
table(nellsw2$w2scf1, useNA="always")
nellsw2$cm_health <- 6 - nellsw2$w2scf1

```

And test the direct effect. Naturally, there are many ways to test for a direct effects in R but in this tutorial I will try to do everything at least also in the package **Lavaan**. 

But first plot the associations:
```{r}
#I randomly select 200 respondents otherwise the plot will be too crowded
selection <- sample(1:length(nellsw2$cm_income_ind), 200, replace=FALSE) 
#because we are interested in a correlation, I plot the standardized variables

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(nellsw2$cm_income_ind[selection], nellsw2$cm_health[selection])
abline(lm(nellsw2$cm_health~nellsw2$cm_income_ind), lwd=4, col="red")

boxplot(cm_health ~ cm_partner, data=nellsw2, notch=TRUE)

```
I hope you observe that the regression line does not fit the data very well and that the means/median of health does not differ much whether or not you have a partner. 

And now,...estimate the direct effect via `lm()`:

```{r}
summary(lm(nellsw2$cm_health ~ nellsw2$cm_income_ind))
summary(lm(nellsw2$cm_health ~ nellsw2$cm_partner))
summary(lm(nellsw2$cm_health ~ nellsw2$cm_income_ind + nellsw2$cm_partner))
```
And with **Lavaan**.

```{r}
require(lavaan)

model <- '
  cm_health ~ cm_income_ind
  cm_health ~ cm_partner
  cm_income_ind ~~ cm_partner
'
```  
  
```{r}
nellsw2$cm_partner <- as.numeric(nellsw2$cm_partner)

fit <- sem(model, data = nellsw2) #I use sem instead of lavaan. The only advantage is that I don't have to tell lavaan that I also need the error variances. 
summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)
inspect(fit,'r2') #to obtain r-squared
#parameterEstimates(fit)
```
Let us briefly discuss the results:  

- The direct effect for income on health does not change once we include our partner variable.   
- You will also observe that having a partner does not contribute to our SWB.  
- Money makes you happy but a partner does not.  
- According to the results, having a partner is positively related to income.  

Given the above, you may want to go back to your theoretical drawing board. And perhaps having done so, you now would like to estimate the following model: 

```{r}
require(lavaan)

model <- '
  cm_income_ind ~ cm_health 
  cm_income_ind ~ cm_partner
  cm_income_ind ~ 1
  cm_health ~~ cm_partner
'
```  
  
```{r}
nellsw2$cm_partner <- as.numeric(nellsw2$cm_partner)

fit <- sem(model, data = nellsw2) #I use sem instead of lavaan. The only advantage is that I don't have to tell lavaan that I also need the error variances. 
summary(fit, standardized=TRUE)
inspect(fit,'r2') #to obtain r-squared
#parameterEstimates(fit)
```


**Take Home Messages**  

- It is easy to estimate equivalent models with similar fits but with a different interpretation.
